# ✨ my_python_code

The aim of this repository is to document my journey with Python as I study **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** at **University of Gdańsk** (Class of 2026).  
You'll find interactive notebooks, text analysis projects, and various small coding experiments I've worked on along the way.
